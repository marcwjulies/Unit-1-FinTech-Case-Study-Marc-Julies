### History

The owner of Shufti Pro and current CTO is Shahid Hanif. He mentions that the story of Shufti Pro began with a bad experience that he had with one of the identity verification service providers. In 2012, working as a developer of a financial institution, he was tasked to integrate a famous KYC solution of that time as part of a major digitization project of a financial institute. After multiple failures and delays, the solution was implemented but the project was cancelled and the institution reverted to manual KYC. The main causes of the project failure was related to:
* inadequate code of the KYC solution
* Lack of development support

Another bad experience in 2017 was when he was to receive a payment from a digital bank. They requested his ID documents and it literally took a month to perform the KYC verification and recieve payment.

This provided him with the impetus to bridge the gap in the digital identity verification industry. During his free time he began working on AI-based KYC & AML solution. Within two months Shufti Pro was registered and in the market on 31st October 2017 with all the exciting features and competitive prices.
