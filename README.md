Shufti Pro uses a combination of artificial intelligence and human intelligence to enable automated identity verification in a seamless manner. It deployed 900+ business models to develop enhanced AI for highly efficient identity verification. Businesses looking for efficient digital identity verification and authentication solutions can benefitfrom real-time, global services.

Shufti Pro provides a multi-layered risk cover against digital identity fraud, money laundering and terrorist financing. Verifications are performed within 30-60 seconds, and services are available in 230+ countries in over 150 languages. AML screening is performed against 1700+ watchlists.


### History

The owner of Shufti Pro and current CTO is Shahid Hanif. He mentions that the story of Shufti Pro began with a bad experience that he had with one of the identity verification service providers. In 2012, working as a developer of a financial institution, he was tasked to integrate a famous KYC solution of that time as part of a major digitization project of a financial institute. After multiple failures and delays, the solution was implemented but the project was cancelled and the institution reverted to manual KYC. The main causes of the project failure was related to:
* inadequate code of the KYC solution
* Lack of development support

Another bad experience in 2017 was when he was to receive a payment from a digital bank. They requested his ID documents and it literally took a month to perform the KYC verification and recieve payment.

This provided him with the impetus to bridge the gap in the digital identity verification industry. During his free time he began working on AI-based KYC & AML solution. Within two months Shufti Pro was registered and in the market on 31st October 2017 with all the exciting features and competitive prices.

Shufti Pro has raised a total of $20M in funding over 1 round. This was a Series A round raised on Mar 15, 2022. They are funded by Updata Partners.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

The pandemic has precipitated a shift where many services we might have used in person are now accessible via the web and apps, but at the same time, the amount of cybercrime aimed at abusing that environment is on the rise, and both trends fuel a stronger demand for ID verification tools.

Jumio, has built a platform that provides a variety of digital identity tools and technology — using biometrics, machine learning, computer vision, big data and more to run checks on ID documents, log-ins, to help prevent suspicious financial activity, identity theft and more. Jumoi uses informed AI and machine learning to build the next generation of online identity and verification and AML technologies. Jumio is helping business reduce fraud and maintain regulatory complaince, while increasing revenue and providing fast and seamless customer experience.

The products at Jumio can be classified into two main buckets
* Identity Corroboration
* Anti Mode Solutions

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

Target industries include:


|Retail                                                | Financial Services                                  | Gaming                                         |
|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| AI-powered solutions and mobile commerce optimization|
| Higher conversion rates                              |
| Mitigating fraud                                     | 
| Great mobile experience for customers                |


Currently, Jumio’s primary business is B2B: It provides tools to enterprise customers like HSBC to manage digital identity verification. Some of the areas where it will be investing include expanding its AI capabilities to do more anti-money laundering work, and to look at building a B2C product, using the data, tools and network of customers that it has to help individuals better manage their identities online.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

It’s also distinctive for having developed a platform approach, where it offers a range of different kinds of tools. This is in contrast to many others, which — partly as newer entrants — are focusing on more specific technology or addressing a narrower aspect of what is a pretty complex problem. That said, the company’s earliest work seems to still be the mainstay of what it does. The number of documents that it can “read” to begin the process of verifying users now numbers about 3,500. That has propelled more than 300 million verifications made on Jumio’s platform.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
